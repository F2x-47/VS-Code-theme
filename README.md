# Dark color theme for Visual Studio Code
This repository contains files of my Visual Studio Code theme.

## How to use it ?
To use this color theme in your own VS Code, you need to install _yo_ and _generato-code_. If you have an error message : you can try with administrator permissions.
```
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

After, you need to run these extensions.
```
yo code
```
Now you need to select "**New color theme**", "**No, start fresh**". You can call the now theme as you wish.
Now, you need to open the file _JSON_ in the foler '_themes_' and paste the code of the file '_theme-settings.json_' of this repository.

THANKS !
